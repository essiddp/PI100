    <h1>Rizal as an Artist</h1>
    <p>Other than writing, Jose Rizal also expresses himself artistically. He developed an interest in the arts at the young age of nine. “I had already such a liking for this art that our schoolmates called José Guevarra, another pupil, and myself the class painters,” as mentioned in his diary Rizal’s Own Story of His Life. As he grows older, he further enhances his skills and interest in the arts. As a visual artist, he created portraits and figurative representations of those he encountered during his exile in Dapitan and throughout his travels in Europe. An art exhibit in the National Museum of Fine Arts is dedicated to the works by and about Jose Rizal entitled “Inspiring the Nation, Dr. Jose Rizal: The National Hero in Art.”</p>
    <h2>Some of Jose Rizal’s famous artworks and background are listed below:</h2>
