        <h1>Rizal as a Writer</h1>
        <hr>

            Some of his works that we have studied in our class are presented below:

            <h2>Noli Me Tangere</h2>
            <p>In 1887, Rizal published his first novel, Noli Me Tangere. It became a cornerstone of Philippine literature, exposing the injustices in our country. Crisóstomo Ibarra, a young man returning home after studying abroad, faces discrimination and abuse from those in power. This harsh reality leads him to question the system. The title, meaning "Touch me not" in Latin, hints at tragic events and his fight for justice.</p>

            <h2>El Filibusterismo</h2>
            <p>Rizal returned with a darker companion to Noli Me Tangere - El Filibusterismo in the year 1891. He introduces Simoun, a wealthy jeweler, who was secretly Crisóstomo Ibarra. Seeking for justice, he plots a fiery rebellion against the oppressive rule. The work explores the desperate fight for freedom, the price of revolution, and the factors that contribute to a broken society.</p>

            <p>In this essay, written in 1889, Rizal reached out to the young women of Malolos, Bulacan. Although the meaning behind his statements may be ironic and questionable, it tells them to pursue their education and be instruments of change to our country.</p>
