            Some of his works that we have studied in our class are presented below:

            <h2>Noli Me Tangere</h2>
            <p>Published in 1887, Noli Me Tangere is considered Rizal's first novel. It's a social commentary that exposes the injustices and corruption within Philippine society during Spanish colonization. The story follows Crisóstomo Ibarra, a young man who returns to the Philippines after studying in Europe. He faces discrimination and abuse of power from the church and government officials, leading him to question the status quo. The title comes from the Latin phrase meaning "Touch me not," which foreshadows the tragic events and societal resistance the novel explores.

            <h2>El Filibusterismo</h2>
            <p>Published in 1891, El Filibusterismo is the sequel to Noli Me Tangere. It takes a darker and more revolutionary approach. The protagonist, Simoun, is a mysterious jeweler who is actually Crisóstomo Ibarra, now a disillusioned and radicalized figure. He plots a violent uprising against the Spanish authorities. The novel delves into themes of revolution, societal decay, and the struggle for freedom.</p>

            <h2>Ang Liham sa mga Kababaihan ng Malolos</h2>
            <p>This 1889 essay is addressed to young women in Malolos who were advocating for opening a secondary school for girls. Despite being addressed to women, the essay will show you that the title is quite ironic from it's content.</p>
