            <p>“Among the arts, music was Rizal’s first love,” according to Mrs. Asuncion Bantug, Rizal’s grandniece. According to his contemporary, Dr. Galicano Apacible, Rizal struggled with the art of music, yet he was determined to excel in this field, as with others. Rizal studied how to play the flute, solfeggio, piano, and voice culture. Later in life, he started composing his own songs, most of which were poems he created and set to music. A few of his known compositions are the following: Kundiman ni Rizal, Alin Mang Lahi, and Leonor.</p>

        <p>His song "Leonor" was dedicated to Leonor Rivera, one of the women he loved. He wrote and composed it before his departure to Europe, intending it as a farewell to Leonor Rivera.</p>
