            <p>“Among the arts, music was Rizal’s first love.” This was according to Mrs. Asuncion Bantug, Rizal’s grandniece. According to his contemporary, Dr. Galicano Apacible, Rizal struggled with the art of music yet he was determined to excel in this field, similarly with others. Rizal had studied how to play the flute, solfeggio, piano, and voice culture. Later in life, he started composing his songs, most of them poems he created that were accompanied by a tune. A few of his known compositions are the following: Kundiman ni Rizal, Alin Mang Lahi, and Leonor.</p>

        <p>His song Leonor, was dedicated to Leonor Rivera, one of the women he loved. He wrote and composed this before his departure to Europe. He meant for the song to be his farewell to Leonor Rivera.</p>
