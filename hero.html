    <h1>Rizal as a Hero</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>José Rizal is regarded as the national hero of the Philippines due to his significant contributions to the country's struggle for independence from Spanish colonial rule. One of the main reasons he is considered a hero is his literary works, particularly the novels "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo." Through these works, Rizal exposed the abuses and injustices of the Spanish government in the Philippines, awakening national sentiments among Filipinos and urging them to seek change and freedom.</p>
    
    <p>Apart from his literary contributions, Rizal was known as an advocate for peaceful reform and envisioned a society that liberated his countrymen through education and political awareness. He became a symbol of intellect and honor for Filipinos, displaying courage in facing the challenges of his time.</p>
    
    <p>His martyrdom at the hands of the Spanish on December 30, 1896, brought about a significant shift in the actions of Filipinos. He demonstrated dedication and bravery in his belief in the goal of Philippine freedom. His life and sacrifice served as inspiration for Filipinos to continue the fight for their freedom, ultimately resulting in the independence of the Philippines from Spanish colonial rule.</p>
