    <h1>Rizal as a child</h1>
    <p>José Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines, had a remarkable childhood that significantly influenced his later life and achievements. Born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, Rizal was the seventh of eleven children in a well-off family. His parents, Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonso, were highly respected in their community. His mother, Teodora, played a crucial role in his early education, teaching him to read and write at a very young age. This early exposure to learning, coupled with his natural curiosity and intelligence, set the stage for his later accomplishments.</p>
    
    <p>As a child, Rizal was noted for his exceptional intellect and a deep love for learning. He learned the alphabet by the age of three and could read and write by the age of five. His family's library, which contained a diverse collection of books, was his playground. Rizal's early education also included attending a private school in Biñan, where he was sent at the age of nine. Here, he studied under the tutelage of Justiniano Aquino Cruz, who further honed his academic skills, particularly in Spanish and Latin.</p>
    
    <p>Rizal's childhood was not without its challenges. He experienced firsthand the injustices of the Spanish colonial regime, which would later fuel his desire for reform. One significant incident was the arrest and persecution of his mother, Teodora, who was falsely accused of poisoning her sister-in-law. This event left a profound impact on young Rizal, instilling in him a strong sense of justice and a determination to fight against oppression.</p>

    <p>Throughout his childhood, Rizal displayed a variety of talents. He was a skilled artist, carving figures out of clay and wax, and also showed an early interest in poetry. His poem "Sa Aking Mga Kabata" (To My Fellow Youth), written when he was just eight years old, reflects his early patriotism and his belief in the importance of education and love for one's country.</p>

    <p>Rizal's formative years laid a solid foundation for his future role as a reformer and nationalist. The combination of a supportive family, a passion for learning, and an acute awareness of social injustices shaped him into the influential figure he would become.</p>
